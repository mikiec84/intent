# When "why" is missing

How many times have youâ€¦

* Been surprised by new requirements?
* Begged for design docs to clarify inherited code?
* Written comments but feared someone would miss a subtlety?
* Struggled to grok a messy state machine or tangle of threads?
* Sanitized input to a function, unable to trust preconditions?
* Wondered if coders cared at all about the user experience?
* Felt a communication gap between execs/sales/PM/dev/PS?

All of these experiences are symptoms that the why of software development--its intent--is missing or unclear.
