Programming is getting [more complex and harder](the-need-for-intent.md). Tools are improving... but too slowly. Other approaches treat the "why" of code--its intent--as an external, human concern.

Intent is a programming language--and ecosystem--that's teaming with next-gen features--but what really differentiates it is its focus on people and their whys. You'll be amazed what a difference that makes.
