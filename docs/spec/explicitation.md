# Explication

A theme in intent: make things clear.

Doesn't mean make things verbose; once we've expressed a rule, compiler can enforce it and IDE can remind us about semantics without overloading everything. The idea is to say what you mean, once--and then let the system make sure that meaning is remembered and handled correctly everywhere else.
