date constraint such as (in the past) or (in the future) -- see the hilarious date errors at http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Great-Caesars-Host!.aspx
interruptible or uninterruptible (somewhat like critical sections, but these are less about multithreading [where flow may be suspended and eventually resume], and more about interrupts that permanently yank control away as in real-time/embedded OSes)
reasonable upper/lower bound (indicates the design tolerances of an algorithm or parameter)
potential gotcha
