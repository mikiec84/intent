# Key Features

Intent is a programming language with a hybrid paradigm that incorporates the best of imperative, functional, and declarative approaches. It is object-oriented, type-safe, concurrency-savvy, and general-purpose. It can call C libraries (.so, .dll) as well as java and other JVM-based languages. Intent compiles down to native binaries for C-like performance, or it can be translated to JVM byte code, python, C++ 11, or other high-level syntaxes.

## Unique

marks	Lets programmers declare semantics and intent in a human-friendly way, with compiler enforcement. [more]
code as hypertext	Any statement, file, folder, or other structure unit can be the anchor of a hyperlink. Code can formally link to other sites, and can have attachments. [more]
collaborative compilation	Compiler carries out housekeeping tasks based on programmer hints. Warnings are questions that programmers can eliminate by answering. Answers are sticky. [more]
polyglot compilation	Compiles to various targets including other high-level languages. [more]
generated interfaces	For each public class, the analog to a C++ header is generated from the implementation, by the compiler. This lets producers of a class write implementation only, without worrying about maintaining a second file--while at the same time allowing consumers to code against a pure interface. Interfaces are automatically versioned in an intelligent way. [more]
statements instead of lines	Uses a unique approach to line wrapping that eliminates a lot of tedious reformatting. [more]
names with spaces	Identifiers in intent can (and usually do) have spaces. [more]
step routines and stubs	Complex routines can be split into bite-sized chunks easily. Stubs can be declared with minimal fuss, and the compiler will implement them. [more]
integrated roles, stories, scenarios, and epics	Many agile best practices are reflectable (or required) in code constructs. [more]
constructs higher than application	Supports fabric-wide configuration, discovery, and message exchange. [more]
lifecycles	Requires object state evolution to be formally modeled, which drastically simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance. [more]
problems and circuit-breakers	Allows declaration of conditions that should trigger escalations elsewhere in a codebase. These declarations can be injected in IoC pattern. [more]
optional garbage collection	By default, uses deterministic destructors and an RAII style of resource management. However, can be translated to a GC world for interop with java and similar environments. [more]
semantic interface compatibility	Can test for compatible interface overlap instead of exact interface versions. [more]

## Familiar but cool

design by contract	Makes declaring and enforcing preconditions and postconditions easy.
closures and lambdas	Pass execution state to other parts of a program.
actor model	Approaches concurrency like Erlang or Scala, with a few tweaks. Includes Erlang's notion of supervisors of processes. [more]
nested constructors	Call one constructor from another to avoid writing boilerplate code. Compare to C++ 11.
meta code	Write code that performs static assertions, code generation, and much more. Think macros, cleanly implemented, on steroids.
generics	Containers, classes, and algorithms that are templatized by type. Variadic generics.
very robust string and regex handling	Not as rich as perl, but close.
universal function call syntax	Call a function with first arg = class instance, just like it was a member of the class. Allows classes to be extended after compilation. Compare to D.
scope exit handlers	Define what will happen if you leave a scope with failure, early success, or normal success.
AOP and dependency injection	Define aspects; inject behaviors in a way that cross-cuts codebases.
and of course...	xUnit-based testing (spock-compatible), reflection, unicode and localization support, REPL, docs from code comments, and lots of other standard goodies.
